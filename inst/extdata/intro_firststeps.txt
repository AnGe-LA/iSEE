#Welcome;Welcome to the tour for iSEE!
#allpanels;Take a look around...
#redDimPlot1;someTextPlaceholder, this is plot 1 for reduced dimension representations
#colDataPlot1;someTextPlaceholder, this is plot 1 for column data representations
#geneExprPlot1;someTextPlaceholder, this is plot 1 for gene expression representations
#geneStatTable1;someTextPlaceholder, this is table 1 for gene-level information, which can be linked to other plots as well
#redDimMakeNew;someTextPlaceholder, create a new red dim plot
#colDataMakeNew;someTextPlaceholder, create a new col data plot
#geneExprMakeNew;someTextPlaceholder, create a new gene expr plot
#geneStatMakeNew;someTextPlaceholder, create a new table, also useful for linking to other plots
#panelOrganization;someTextPlaceholder, here you can reorganize the panel layout
#redDim1ShiftDown;someTextPlaceholder, you can shift the plot one place down
#redDim1ShiftUp;someTextPlaceholder, or up
#redDim1Discard;someTextPlaceholder, or even remove it
#redDim1PanelWidth;someTextPlaceholder, or change its width (not perfectly linked to the element, strange)
#redDimPlotPanelOpen1;someTextPlaceholder, you have plenty of options to control the appearance of the plots, here for the plot itself
#redDimColorPanelOpen1;someTextPlaceholder, here for the coloring options
#redDimBrushPanelOpen1;someTextPlaceholder, and here for brushing a.k.a. linking two different plots together
#getcode_all;someTextPlaceholder, while here you can extract the code for reproducing the exact code used to generate the plots
#Thanks;Thank you for taking the tour!
